# Octave Hacking

Octave Hacking is an attempt to turn VS Code into a decent IDE for [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

## Features

* Syntax highlighting
* Outline view and code navigation for functions
* Snippets
  * functions, classdefs, and common control structures

## Debugging

Octave Hacking does not support debugging Octave inside VS Code.
For that, I recommend you install the [Octave Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulosilva.vsc-octave-debugger) extension by Paulo Silva.
